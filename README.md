# An-Explainable-AI-based-Skin-Diease-Detection
Automated detection of Skin disease using deep learning technique and provide Explain-ability technique to help us better understands our model's predictions, and how we could further improve its performance.


The model was able to successfully extract feature from the dataset. The results obtained with deep learning based Resnet-50 model is of 91.62%. 
The output of SHAP and GRAD CAM is a list of explanations, reflecting the contribution of each feature to the prediction of a data sample.
On Comparing the SHAP and GRAD CAM results the gradcam gives the better explanation than SHAP model.
